          "description": "Washington, DC’s H Street corridor was built in 1849. Streetcars followed 23 years later, creating a successful business center and encouraging development in the neighborhood. They ran up and down the street for exactly 100 years until buses replaced them in 1949. Throughout the early and mid-1900s, the area was one of the city’s commercial hubs, known for its art and dining scene, much like it is now. It was even lined with department stores, including DC’s first Sears.",

In early 2005, the theater was reincarnated as the Atlas Performing Arts Center, and new restaurants, bars and businesses began to follow. Today, H Street has turned into one of the nightlife centers of the city, with music venues, bars and plenty of options for late-night eats.",
